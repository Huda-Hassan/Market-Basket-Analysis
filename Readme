# 🛒 Market Basket Analysis

This project performs Market Basket Analysis on grocery transaction data to discover purchasing patterns and relationships between items using the Apriori algorithm.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze customer purchase behavior and identify:

- Frequently bought items  
- Association rules between products  
- Items that are often purchased together  

This helps businesses improve product placement, recommendations, and marketing strategies.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Data cleaning (handling duplicates and formatting dates)  
3. Transaction transformation (basket format)  
4. Frequent itemset generation using Apriori  
5. Association rules extraction  
6. Data visualization (Top items & rules)
